I like those moments when you rewatch a movie, not expecting much apart from simple entertainment
and you get hit by a quote that you can't stop thinking about (happens more often as I get closer to
40th birthdayâ€¦):

> The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to
> prolong them. I shall use my time.

The movie is "No Time to Die"[^1], the latest addition to the James Bond movie saga, the quote is
attributed to Jack London[^2].

It's actually a part of a longer credo:

> I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant
> blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, ever atom of me in
> magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not
> to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.
