Continuing the preservation of some of my Pocket saves, this time a talk from Tanya Reilly - "Being
glue"[^1] - on all those little things that make the difference as you get to a senior experience
level.

I like to revisit it, when my frustration level rises as once again I had no possibility to
finish the worked I planned because of different "distractions".

> Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often
> less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue
> work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be
> career limiting. It can push people into less technical roles and even out of the industry.
