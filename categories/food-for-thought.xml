Sam Kaner with Lenny Lind, Catherine Toldi, Sarah Fisk and Duane Berger is probably my favourite
resource for anyone who wants to bring their facilitation skills to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concepts shown in it, that made a significant impact on my approach to cooperation is
definitely gradients of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.carno.pl/images/posts/gradients-of-agreement.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gradients of agreement" src="https://blog.carno.pl/images/posts/gradients-of-agreement.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" title="Gradients of agreement - Community At Work © 2014"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the whole concept is probably worth it's own post, today I would like to focus on the part of
the scale that changed my approach to communicating while working on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that "done is better than perfect" but it's not easy to let go of our vision, of our
built-in rules and expectations, especially in a world that is highly polarized - you have to be for
or against, zero or one, no middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where &lt;strong&gt;"Don't Like But Will Support"&lt;/strong&gt; position comes in. Just think about it - do we
always have to have the perfect agreement? Will the end result of a discussion or code review by any
better if we continue to dig deeper? Maybe it's already good enough? Maybe it's a matter of personal
preference? Is it worth the time spent for further discussions?&lt;/p&gt;
